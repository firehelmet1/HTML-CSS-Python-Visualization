## Latitude - Latitude Analysis Dashboard with Attitude

In this project, I created a visualization dashboard website using visualizations that I've created in a past assignment. Specifically, I'll be plotting weather data vs. latitude variations.

In building this dashboard, I created individual pages for each plot and a means by which we can navigate between them. These pages will contain the visualizations and their corresponding explanations. There is also have a landing page, where we can see a comparison of all of the plots, and another page where we can view the data used to build them.


### Select Screenshots

This section contains screenshots of each page that must be built, at varying screen widths. These are a guide; you can meet the requirements without having the pages look exactly like the below images.
