This website, (index.html) summarizes weather data gathered from weather stations around the world. 

The website was constructed in raw html code through Visual Studio and uses a brief CSS Style sheet along with the Bootstrap 4 framework, imported inside the file. 

The observation data was accessed and processed with Python using the WeatherPy notebook file. 

WeatherPy produced the weather observation scatter plots using MatPlotLib and also generated an html output table of the raw data (weather_data.html).
